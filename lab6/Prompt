follow the instructions for emplyeee and productionworker classes on page (book 698)


1. Employee and ProductionWorker Classes
Design a class named Employee . The class should keep the following information in fields:
VideoNote
The Employee and
Productionworker
Classes Problem
•	 Employee name
•	 Employee number in the format XXX–L, where each X is a digit within the range 0–9
and the L is a letter within the range A–M.
•	 Hire date
Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class.
Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that extends the Employee class. The
ProductionWorker class should have fields to hold the following information:
•	 Shift (an integer)
•	 Hourly pay rate (a double )
The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift field will be an integer value
representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is
shift 2. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for
the class. Demonstrate the classes by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
