1. Area Class
Write a class that has three overloaded static methods for calculating the areas of the
following geometric shapes:
•	 circles
•	 rectangles
•	 cylinders

Here are the formulas for calculating the area of the shapes.
Area of a circle: Area 5 πr
2
 where π is Math.PI and r is the circle’s radius
Area of a rectangle: Area 5 Width 3 Length
Area of a cylinder: Area 5 πr
2h
 where π is Math.PI, r is the radius of the cylinder’s base, and
 h is the cylinder’s height
Because the three methods are to be overloaded, they should each have the same name, but
different parameter lists. Demonstrate the class in a complete program
