In a course, a teacher gives the following tests and assignments:
•

A lab activity that is observed by the teacher and assigned a numeric score.
A pass/fail exam that has 10 questions. The minimum passing score is 70.
An essay that is assigned a numeric score.
A final exam that has 50 questions.
Write a class named CourseGrades . The class should have a GradedActivity array named
grades as a field. The array should have four elements, one for each of the assignments
previously described. The class should have the following methods:
setLab : This method should accept a GradedActivity object as its argu-
ment. This object should already hold the student’s score for the lab
activity. Element 0 of the grades field should reference this object.
setPassFailExam : This method should accept a PassFailExam object as its argument.
This object should already hold the student’s score for the pass/fail
exam. Element 1 of the grades field should reference this object.
setEssay : This method should accept an Essay object as its argument. (See
Programming Challenge 4 for the Essay class. If you have not
completed Programming Challenge 4, use a GradedActivity object
instead.) This object should already hold the student’s score for
the essay. Element 2 of the grades field should reference this
object.
setFinalExam : This method should accept a FinalExam object as its argument.
This object should already hold the student’s score for the final
exam. Element 3 of the grades field should reference this object.
toString : This method should return a string that contains the numeric
scores and grades for each element in the grades array.
